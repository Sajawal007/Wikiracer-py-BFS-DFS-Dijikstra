# How to run the program?
To run the program, open up the terminal and type the following command:
    "python3 main.py"
    
Note: Place all the files in the same directory to execute program successfully
Be patient while performing the tests, since it takes time to download and work on realtime data. :)

# Things to consider (Important)
      ðŸ‘‰ Program uses cache to store the data as HTML Pages, once visited. This will put less strain on the internet connection and cache will increase the 
      performance of search by looking directly from cache.
      ðŸ‘‰ Websites such as wikipedia or any other sites allows a certain amount of download (Scraping). Hence maintaing a cache also saves us this limit
      Even though during the tests, it never got violated :) It seems enough for our purpose.
